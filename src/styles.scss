    // When to Use: Use Soft Peach as the primary background color for the website or for large sections like the header, footer, or full-page backgrounds.
    // It can also be used for hover effects on buttons to add a subtle warmth.
    --Soft-Peach: #ffdab9;

    // Use Golden Sand for secondary backgrounds, such as content boxes, cards (e.g., for RSVP or event details), or as a divider between sections.
    // It’s also great for text boxes or form fields to maintain readability.
    --Golden-Sand: #f4e1c1;

    // Use Deep Navy for text (like headings or body copy), buttons, and navigation menus.
    // It’s also ideal for borders or icons to create contrast against lighter backgrounds.
    --Deep-Navy: #3d3730;

    // Use Soft White for text on darker backgrounds (like Deep Navy buttons), or as a background for smaller elements like cards or photo captions.
    // It’s also great for accents, such as thin borders or decorative lines.
    --Soft-White: #f8f8f8;

    // Use Muted Coral sparingly for accents, such as button highlights, icons, or decorative elements like floral motifs.
    // It can also be used for call-to-action buttons (e.g., “RSVP Now”) to draw attention.
